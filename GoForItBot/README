There is a sample dufus in src/com/barracuda/ContestServer.java.

You'll need the trunk version of Apache XML-RPC included here in the
src/org/apache/xmlrpc/ tree as the 3.1.3 release version does not support
methods without a package/class prefix. See
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/XMLRPC-182 for the code change that
addresses this.

The example code also uses code from Apache commons, included as jarfiles in
the lib/ directory.

Presumably you'll be using Eclipse or another IDE for java development, but if not,
a build.xml file is provided, you should be able to compile by issuing the ant command
in the current directory. Note that you'll probably want to remove the -nowarn compiler
flag for your own code.

$ ant

This will produce Contest.jar. You can then run from the application from command line:

$ java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=logging.properties -jar Contest.jar

If you don't care about logging for levels below "INFO", then you can omit the
logging property on the above command line:

$ java -jar Contest.jar

To remove build remnants and the jarfile:

$ ant clean
